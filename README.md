An [RPN calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
(or postfix calculator)
is a calculator in which the operators follow the operands.

For example:

```
5 3 2 + *
```

for which the answer is `25`.

This repo contains an RPN calculator implementation which is initially limited to addition only, but which you
will extend to implement further operators.

The calculator is written in python, and you should probably begin by reviewing the code, running the
calculator, and running the test script.
